# Jordan Weather Identifier - Tkinter Legacy (Python 102)
### The Story
This was my second major coding milestone, created during my Python 101 course back when I was nearly 12. I wanted to explore GUI (Graphical User Interface) development. This project was the precursor to my modern Web-based Weather App and more advanced Tkinter GUI.
### The Evolution Pipeline
**Python 101 (This Repo): First GUI experiment using local .txt files and basic if/elif logic.**

**Python 102: Advanced Tkinter GUI with improved styling, Openmeteo API to provide live, global data and information for all cities round the world.**

**Web Dev (Current): A full-stack web application using the Openmeteo API to provide live data and more advanced UI/UX design**

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to run the project locally:

# 1. Clone the repository and enter:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/saifkayyali3/JordanWeatherIdentifier-v1.git
JordanWeatherIdentifier-v1
```
# 2. Make a virtual environment
```bash
python -m venv venv

source venv/bin/activate # Linux/macOS
venv\Scripts\activate # Windows
```

# 3. Run
