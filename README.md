# Jordan Weather Identifier - Tkinter Legacy (Python 102)
### The Story
This was my second major coding milestone, created during my Python 101 course back when I was 12 and a half. I wanted to explore GUI (Graphical User Interface) development, so I made this project, which was also the precursor to my modern Web-based Weather App and more advanced Tkinter GUI.
### The Evolution Pipeline
This web app is the final version of a three-part evolution:
1. **Jordan Weather Legacy v1 (This repo)** - The Prototype: First Python GUI using static File I/O.
2. **[City Weather Identifier v2](https://github.com/saifkayyali3/City-Weather-Identifier-v2)** - Data Viz: Desktop app with live API integration and Seaborn/Matplotlib graphs. 
3. **[City Weather Identifier v3](https://github.com/saifkayyali3/CityWeatherIdentifier-v3)** - Full-Stack: Responsive web app with Flask backend and Pandas data processing.
